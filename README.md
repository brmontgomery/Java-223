# Java-223
Assignments From my Java 223 course.

In order to run each assignment, you must have the Java compiler tools installed (any version after 14.0 is confirmed to work).

## Steps to Run
1. Open a Command Prompt or Linux Shell.
2. Navigate to the folder of the assignment.
3. On Windows or Linux run "sh run.sh". This will compile and run the javascript program.
